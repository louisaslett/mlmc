## Resubmission

This is a resubmission in light of the kind CRAN review by Beni Altmann.
In this version I have:

* Added acronym explanation and single quoted 'C++' in DESCRIPTION, as requested.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* The note arises because the package was archived due to email to the maintainer being undeliverable. I have updating my maintainer email address, at the same time as making a substantial number of updates, bug fixes and improvements to the package.
